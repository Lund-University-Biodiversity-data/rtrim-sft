# Rtrim shinyapp development
This is a project to develop a shinyapp interface for using rtrim to analyse bird trends from Svensk FÃ¥geltaxering (SFT). It includes fetching data from the SFT server, running rtrim analyses and handle the results (some displaying and producing output-files (.xlsx)). 

Files needed should be downloaded to the local computer. Preferably create a Rstudio project (make a project using Rstudio) and add files to this. Files (and folders) needed are:

app.R<br/>
UsefulFunctions.R<br/>
Summarise_Results.R<br/>
www (folder)<br/>
SpeciesWithShorterTimePeriods.xls<br/>
